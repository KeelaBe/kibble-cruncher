# Kibble Cruncher

This is the repo for my website [kibblecruncher.com](kibblecruncher.com).

I am still trying to learn web development, so things in this repo may not follow the best standards.

The tech stack will be:
- Next.js
- Tailwind

These tools are very overkill for the website I am planning to make. I am planning on making a pretty basic website which could very easily be done vith just vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I am planning on statically serving everything including the 'api endpoint' which I am planning on just using a json file at build time. I am using these tools however since I would like to get good with them for future projects I am planning on working on which will benefit from these more powerfull tools. Instead of learning a bunch of different frameworks and running on a treadmill of framework decisions, I am going to just commit to this stack so I can master one thing instead of being just being a beginner with 10 different frameworks. 

Since this is just a hobby project that I one day hope to use for charity, I want it to run as cheap as possible. Since this will likely be a small website, I don't even want there to be a live backend. I plan on statically generating all the content, including the 'api endpoint' which I am planning on just having as a static json file I regenerate daily which has all the product information.

More to come as I build out this site more.
